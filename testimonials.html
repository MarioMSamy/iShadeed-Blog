He provides a nice blend of thinking for himself and filling in the gaps, while paying attention to the details in my feedback. With a quick response time and a palpable integrity, Ahmad is a delight to work with. I will work with him again.

				<p>
					I have worked with Ahmad on an app design project, where he was commissioned to create a cross-platform app design for a new vertical. Ahmad had full responsibility of the design process, from concept to final product.
				    Throughout all steps in the process, Ahmad displayed a high degree of creativity, reliability and integrity. His design style is creative, yet he is very skllled at incorporating customer requirements and staying on spec.
                    Ahmad is very responsive, and went the extra mile to make sure we got everything we asked for, even when we went beyond the initial spec.
					We were very satisfied with the design Ahmad delivered, and I would hire him again for other design projects without hesitation.
